# controle_gastos

The project consists on an mobile app to control exepenses like market and salary receivement.

At the moment the project does not have Linux, Windows or MacOS support due to the use of sqflite lib on the project.

The next step is the implementation of Drift database lib. Which will create support for the not now supported platforms.

Other further step is the use of more cleaner architecture using interfaces for the generalization of the code.
